## About Me

Welcome to my project site! My name is Victoria Burke and I am a Computer Science graduate student at DePaul University interested in Machine Learning and Computational Biology with an anticipated graduation in 2026. I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Finance from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2021. I am a bilingual first generation student eager to begin gaining research experience while learning about computer science outside of the classroom. 

During my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family as well as being active. I play roller derby for the Windy City Rollers, both recreationally and competitively, traveling throughout the midwest to play other teams. In 2023, I ran the Bank of America Chicago Marathon for the organization PAWS, which is dedicated to helping save and find homes for animals, and I hope to be able to participate again in the future! 

If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to send me an email. 
Thank you for taking the time to look at my project!



## About My Advisor

My advisor for this research project is Thiru Ramaraj. Thiru is an Assistant Professor at the School of Computing at DePaul University, with his research focusing on Computational Biology and Applied Bioinformatics. Prior to working at DePaul University, Thiru was a Research Scientist at the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) where he developed computational workflows for high-throughout DNA/RNA sequence data analysis. An extensive list of his publications is available on Google Scholar. Thiru has been extremely helpful during my research project and I look forward to continue working together. 

## About My Project

I am currently assisting with two projects, here's a brief summary about them both: 


1. The brainstem's medullary reticular formation is crucial for controlling vital orofacial motor behaviors like breathing, swallowing, etc. Disruptions in these circuits can lead to conditions such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, dysphagia, and speech disorders. Our research aims to understand the structural and functional organization of the reticular formation and its role in controlling orofacial motor behaviors. We are using machine learning to segment the reticular formation into function-specific nuclei based on gene expression and spatial location, using the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas, focusing on the P4 mice. 

2. This research project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of soil microbiomes through the use of QIIME2 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S rRNA is a component of the 30S small subunit of prokaryotic ribosomes. It is a highly conserved region of the ribosomal RNA, making it an ideal target for studying bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy. QIIME2 allows us to perform analysis which helps us understand the diversity and composition of microbiomes.
