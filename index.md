## About Me

Welcome to my project site! My name is Victoria Burke and I am a Computer Science graduate student at DePaul University interested in Machine Learning and Computational Biology. I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Finance from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2021. I am a bilingual first generation student eager to begin gaining research experience while learning about computer science outside of the classroom. 

During my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family as well as being active. I play roller derby for the Windy City Rollers, both recreationally and competitively, traveling throughout the midwest to play other teams. In 2023, I ran the Bank of America Chicago Marathon for the organization PAWS, which is dedicated to helping save and find homes for animals, and I hope to be able to participate again in the future! 

If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to send me an email. 
Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.
